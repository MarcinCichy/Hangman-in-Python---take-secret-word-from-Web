# Hangman in Python

Hangman game with ASCII fun animation ;)

Two difficulty levels. 
The hard level uses BeautifulSoup to randomize a word from a website specified by the player.
It's works

Have a fun :-)

Some issues to correct in future.

PyCharm:
In "Run Configuration Settings", in section "Execution" set checkbox "Emulate terminal in output console"
